(collectively referred to hereinafter as “ **Parties** ” and individually a “ **Party** ”).

**WHEREAS:**


**(A)** This Agreement provides for the disclosure by GE Life (“ **the** **Disclosing Party** ”) to

**[Name of the Company]** (“ **the Receiving Party** ”) of information which is deemed
confidential by the Disclosing Party.

**(B)** It is understood and agreed that the Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing
Party will be reviewed and used solely for the Healthcare-Insurance Industry Pilot (“ **the**
**Project** ”).

**NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED** between the parties as follows:


1. “ **Affiliate** ” means, in relation to each Party, any company or other entity which is its
holding company or subsidiary, or any subsidiary of its holding company or which
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the company specified. For the purposes of this definition
the term “control” (including the terms “controlling”, “controlled by” and “under common
control with”) means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of
voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

2. “ **Confidential Information** ” means any information at any time and from time to time
supplied by the Disclosing Party and/or its Affiliates to the Receiving Party and/or its
Authorised Persons (as defined below) including, but is not limited to, Personal Data, all
information of a commercial, technical or financial nature relating to the Disclosing Party
and/or its Affiliates which contains, amongst other matters, trade secrets, know-how,
show-how, patents research, development or technical information, confidential and
proprietary product or information, intellectual property right, business plans, operations
or systems, financial and trading positions, details of customers, suppliers, debtors or
creditors, information relating to the officers, directors or employees of Disclosing Party
and/or its Affiliates, marketing information, brochures, printed matter, rates and rate
tables, contracts regardless of form, format or media including, without limitation, written,
oral, or information reduced to tangible form and also includes information communicated
or obtained through meetings, documents, correspondence or inspection of tangible
items. Personal Data shall have the same meaning as set out in the Personal Data
Protection Act (Act No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore.

3. Upon receiving the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall keep in confidence
and shall not disclose to any person or entity:
(a) any of the Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party and/or its
Affiliates;

the Project; and

(c) the identity of any Party whether by name or by any identifiable description in
connection with the Party’s participation in the Project;

except as otherwise provided by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
Receiving Party shall exercise the same degree of care to guard against disclosure or
misuse of such information, as Receiving Party employs with respect to its own
Confidential Information, but in any event, not less than reasonable care (save as such
higher standard as may be prescribed elsewhere in this Agreement) and in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations.

4. The Receiving Party shall:

(a) employ a high standard of care and diligence in securing its office premises,
information processing facilities and information systems that process or store

Confidential Information, unless such internet services comply with ISO 27001
(for information security) and/or ISO 27017 (for cloud services), where
applicable, and have been assessed and approved by the Receiving Party’s
management for enterprise use.

5. The Receiving Party shall make the Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing
Party available only to those of its employees, officers, directors, agents, advisors or any
persons employed by the Receiving Party and/or involved in the Project having a “need
to know” in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (“ **Authorised Person(s)** ”).
The Receiving Party shall keep the Disclosing Party informed of the identity of its
Authorised Persons upon request. Further, the Receiving Party shall not make any other
use of the Confidential Information for its own benefit or that of any third party except for
the purposes of the Project nor make unnecessary copies of the same without the prior
written approval of the Disclosing Party.

6. The Receiving Party shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of Confidential
Information if the same is:

pursuant to this Agreement; or

(c) is or has been lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party without
an obligation of confidentiality; or

Party’s Confidential Information; or

(e) is required to be disclosed pursuant to any applicable laws, rules or regulations
or direction of statutory or regulatory authority or stock exchange or order of a
relevant court of law provided that the Receiving Party shall first obtain the
Disclosing Party’s consent to the contents of such disclosure prior to making of
the same.

7. The Receiving Party shall procure that each of its Authorised Person(s) to whom
Confidential Information is disclosed strictly comply with the terms of this Agreement as if
he was a party thereto, and shall take all steps available to it to enforce such obligations
of confidentiality. The Receiving Party shall be fully responsible for any breach of any of
the terms contained herein by it or any of its Authorised Person(s) and shall indemnify
and hold the Disclosing Party and each of its Affiliates harmless on demand from and
against all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses suffered or
incurred by the Disclosing Party and/or any of its Affiliates arising directly or indirectly
from a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and/or any of its Authorised
Persons.

8. All written Confidential Information or any part thereof (including without limitation,
information incorporated in computer software or held in electronic storage media)
together with any analysis, compilations, studies, reports or other documents or materials
as are in possession, power or control of the Receiving Party shall be returned to the
Disclosing Party and any remaining copies destroyed or expunged by the Receiving
Party, when requested by the Disclosing Party. In the event of the destruction of the

Party, within fourteen (14) days, that such destruction has been accomplished. The

not, in any event, be later than one (1) hour from the discovery of the incident) if there is
any security incident or security breach that involves the loss, leakage or damage of the
Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

10. The rights, powers and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and do not
exclude the rights or remedies provided at law and in equity independently of this
Agreement.

11. The Parties agree and acknowledge that money damages are not a sufficient remedy for
any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and that the Disclosing Party shall
be entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief (as appropriate) as a remedy
for any breach or threatened breach thereof, in addition to any other remedies available
at law or in equity.

12. The obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information provided
hereof and the undertakings and obligations in this Agreement shall survive perpetually
from the date of this Agreement.

13. The Disclosing Party does not warrant that the Confidential Information will meet the
requirements of the Receiving Party or that such Confidential Information, when
combined with other information or when used in a particular manner by the Receiving
Party, will be sufficient or suitable for the Receiving Party’s purposes. The Disclosing

Party does not assume any responsibility or liability nor makes any representation or
warranty whatsoever under this Agreement for any consequences of the use of the
Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or its Authorised Person(s) or for its
accuracy, completeness or sufficiency thereof. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall
not have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for any errors or omissions in or any
decision made by the Receiving Party in reliance on the Confidential Information. This
Agreement shall create no obligation whatsoever on the Disclosing Party to disclose any
particular kind or quantity of information to the Receiving Party.

13A. The Receiving Party shall (and shall procure that any of its Authorised Persons) comply
with all privacy and data protection laws, rules, regulations and guidelines which are or
which may in the future be applicable to the terms of this Agreement.

13B. Without prejudice to Clause 4, the Receiving Party shall ensure that it has in place
appropriate technical and contractual measures to ensure the security of the Personal
Data (and to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data and
against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, the Personal Data), as required
under the privacy and data protection laws: and


(a) provide the Disclosing Party with such information as the Disclosing Party may
require to satisfy itself that the Receiving Party is complying with its obligations
under the privacy and data protection laws;

(b) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any breach of the security measures
required to be put in place pursuant to this clause; and

(c) ensure it does not knowingly or negligently do or omit to do anything which
places the Disclosing Party in breach of the Disclosing Party’s obligations under
the privacy and data protection laws.

14. This Agreement is not intended to constitute, create, give effect to, or otherwise
recognise a joint venture, partnership or formal business entity of any kind. Any
exchange of Confidential Information under this Agreement shall not be deemed as
constituting any offer, acceptance, or promise of any further contract or amendment to
any contract which may exist between the Parties. Each Party shall act as an
independent contractor and not as an agent of the other for any purpose whatsoever and
neither shall have any authority to bind the other.

15. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant, whether directly or by
implication, any right, (whether by licence or otherwise), under any patent(s), patent
applications, copyrights or other intellectual property rights with respect to any
Confidential Information.

16. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to
the safeguarding of the said Confidential Information and supersedes all prior
communications and understandings with respect thereto. No waiver, alteration,
modification, or amendment shall be binding or effective for any purpose whatsoever
unless and until reduced to writing and executed by authorised representatives of all the
Parties.

17. Each provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement shall be construed separately and

to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
unenforceability or invalidity, without affecting the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

18. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in all respects in accordance with the
laws of Singapore and the Parties shall submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the

terms of this Agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which
exists or is available apart from the Act.
